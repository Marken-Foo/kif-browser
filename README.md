# KIF browser #

A little program to solve a specific need.

Shogi players may have a collection of hundreds of tsumeshogi kifu in .kif files. However, as far as I'm aware there isn't a program to simply and quickly step back and forth through these files. Especially for stronger players who can solve each problem at a glance, the total time taken opening each file in turn can be many times more than the actual solving.

This little bit of Python aims to let shogi players train with their large collections of tsumeshogi quickly and efficiently.

## How to use ##

Have the files in the same folder, and run the file `kif_browser_gui.py` from the command line.
